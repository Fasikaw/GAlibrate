GAlibrate is a python toolkit that provides an easy to use interface for model calibration/parameter estimation using an implementation of continuous genetic algorithm-based optimization.

Although GAlibrate provides a general framework for running continuous genetic algorithm-based optimizations, it was created with systems biology models in mind. It therefore supplies additional tools for working with biological models in the PySB format.
